# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Are (most) Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer:
  Most Ruby methods are accessors, it's not common practice to mutate code too much in ruby, mostly just extract information of data. 

  Researched answer:
  Most Ruby Methods are accessors, if you wanted to permanently change an object in Ruby you can use the bang operator or when using the "setter" method in Class's.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A block is a function that gets passed into a Ruby method and it's usually stating what to 'do' with your value or index, or string. It can usually be found at the begining of an iteration. 

  Researched answer:
  Ruby Blocks are an "Anonymous" function that are inclosed in a "do" and "end". It is Ruby's version of a method call.
3. What is a gem?

  Your answer:
  A gem is basically an open-sourced bundle of code you can download only in Ruby. An example of this would be the rspec testing suit.

  Researched answer:
  All Ruby Gems are comprised of 3 main elements which are 1)Code( ie the rspec testing), 2)Documentation, and 3)gemspec ( it's own library for you to create your own gems)


4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
  A relational Data base is a table or for lack of a better word "database" that holds information that is accessable by calling upon specific attributes that exisit within the colums or rows of the table. 

  Researched answer:
  A Relational Data Base can house a collection of data in a table that contains rows and columns and the data can be called upon in any fassion without having to re-arrange the table. 


5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:
  I hope I'm right in assuming this question is still in regaurds to data bases. If that's the case, I believe a primary key is usually the first column in a relational data base that assigns a key as a unique identifier so if other values share the same names or attributes they will have the key to deferentiate. 

  Researched answer:
  In a Data Base, primary keys are assigned to objects to instantiate a unique identity. The key acts as a secondary source of identity in the instance that there are same name values. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:
RESTful routing to the best of my understanding looks like a data table that is set up to help developers organize URL paths for users. It will give the developer the route name, the url path, weather it's a get, post, patch, and it's purpose and weather or not to delete it.

2. JSON:
JSON stands for (JavaScript Object Notation) and it is the textbase language to use in databases when using javascript. 

3. ERB:
ERB = Ruby's JSX? Kinda sorta? It's Ruby that is imbeded  in HTML. and it will show up as .erb after an html file. This is somthing we will find in Rails and it will be in tags like this <%=%>

4. Params:
Params seems like Rails version of state, but it's always going to be a string and.

5. API:
API= (Application Programming Interface) and it is the software that allows applications to communicate.
